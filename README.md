AVL Tree Data Structure

## Definition

AVL tree is a binary search tree in which the difference of heights of left and right subtrees of any node is less than or equal to one. The technique of balancing the height of binary trees was developed by Adelson, Velskii, and Landi and hence given the short form as AVL tree or Balanced Binary Tree.
