### Important Terms:

Following are the important terms with respect to tree.

* <b>Path</b> − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.
* <b>Root</b> − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.
* <b>Parent</b> − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.
* <b>Child</b> − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.
* <b>Leaf</b> − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.
* <b>Subtree</b> − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.
* <b>Visiting</b> − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.
* <b>Traversing</b> − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.
* <b>Levels</b> − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.
* <b>Keys</b> − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.
